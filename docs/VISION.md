## User Stories?

The One-Liner
> "Your interests, briefed to you through any AI assistant."

AI generated, do not anchor on that heavily.

### Daily Use

"As a user, I can say 'give me my morning briefing' and get a summary of what's new across all my SmartFeed."

"As a user, I can say 'what's new in football?' and get updates for just that topic."

"As a user, I can say 'go deeper on that Anthropic announcement' and get more detail on a specific item."


### Setup & Personalization

"As a user, I can tell my AI assistant 'I care about AI research, especially what Anthropic publishes. Premier League football, and Cristiano Ronaldo' and it remembers."

"As a user, I can say 'I'm also into anime now' and my feed expands."

"As a user, I can say 'drop the anime stuff' and it disappears."



### Feed Hygiene

"As a user, I can say 'what am I subscribed to?' and see my current interests."
"As a user, I can say 'show me what sources you're pulling from' to understand where info comes from."

I don't know, something has to change.

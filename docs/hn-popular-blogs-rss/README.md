This is an OPML version of the HN Popularity Contest results for 2025, for importing into RSS feed readers.

Plug: if you want to find content related to your interests from thousands of obscure blogs and noisy sources like HN Newest, check out Scour. It's a free, personalized content feed I work on where you define your interests in your own words and it ranks content based on how closely related it is to those topics.

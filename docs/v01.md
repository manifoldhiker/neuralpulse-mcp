Main Objective: scaffolding of MCP server with e2e connection.

## What was done

- Scaffolded a TypeScript MCP server (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` + `zod` + `rss-parser`)
- Single tool exposed: `get_feed` — fetches RSS/Atom feeds, returns raw items (title, link, date, snippet)
- Summarization is intentionally left to the calling LLM
- Server runs over stdio, registered in `.cursor/mcp.json` for Cursor integration
- Feed sources configured in `feeds.json` — currently 2 subscriptions:
  1. simonwillison.net
  2. Marca Football (English)

## Project structure

```
src/
  index.ts    — MCP server entry, registers get_feed tool, stdio transport
  feeds.ts    — RSS fetching + parsing (parallel fetch, sorted by date)
  config.ts   — reads feed list from feeds.json
feeds.json    — feed subscriptions
```
